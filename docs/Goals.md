# When I get back to work:

- Write more testing code as I go to provide a more maintainable piece of software.
- Be more clear in my variable names and functions so that everything is as loosely coupled as possible
- write the code I wish I had
- think about when someone who has no idea what my code does is reading it for the first time.
